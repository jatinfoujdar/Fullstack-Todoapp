# Fullstack-Todoapp

 we will be making a simple To-do List app using node.js and mongoDB.


## Basics :

    ### Node.js: Node.js is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
    ### MongoDB: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
    ### Express : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    ### CRUD: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Which are the basic operations that a simple web app would be designed to achieve.
    ### Rest: If you didn’t hear about REST before
